# EscapeRoom

Escape room is a game written in React and C# with SignalR.
It was built as part of a a team building exercise to be used during coronavirus 2019 for my team at work.
The project was treat like a game jam and took around 4 hours total to complete over 7 days (in between my normal work!)
